Find all applicable files to scrape

allfiles = list.files(getwd(), pattern)
allfiles
```
Helper: reads file into a table and then writes it as a .txt file
```{r}
getfile = function(filename){
  table = read.csv(filename, header=FALSE)
  newname = gsub(".csv", ".txt", filename)
  write.table(table[1:49,1:204], file=newname, sep="\t", row.names = F, col.names = F)
}
```
Load all files into vectors using helper `getfile`
```{r}
sapply(as.vector(allfiles), getfile)
```
